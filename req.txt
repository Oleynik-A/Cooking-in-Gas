Goals
Add functionality from “Chrome Autofill Extension” to our custom solution “Cooking on Gas” (extension). 
Currently Cooking on Gas does support Supreme, and Shopify.
Functionality to be ported over is complete autofill for:
Stripe
Footlocker
BigCartel
Any regex field matches ie “First Name”, “City” etc

Additional functionality needed:
Checkbox for terms & Conditions
Random Birthday (18-45yo), Must work on footlocker
Both should have regex capacity to add additional fields
